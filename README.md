# Loteria
Play the famous Mexican Bingo

# Overview
Learn to Play Loteria Game or Mexican Bingo.


# Project
This game was inspired by the famous Loteria Game. It is a game commonly played with big groups at Mexican gatherings. Michelle Flores' Loteria brings back the culture to the digital world.


# PLAY:
In order to beat this game (against the computer), you will have to fill all 15 boxes on your board with a card that matches your box. If 'frog card' is called out and you have a frog on your box, click your box and the spot will be filled. GREAT, now beat the computer and try to have your 15 boxes filled first.

As soon as all your 15 boxes are filled, you must click "LOTERIA" button in order to win. Remember, this is a game of speed, so you have to beat the computer in filling your boxes & clicking "LOTERIA".

Once you dive into the culture and learn this game is extremely fun, I hope you play the original game with your family.:)
